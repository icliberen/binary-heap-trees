# Binary Search Tree, Balanced Binary Tree and Heap Implementations in C++

This project demonstrates multiple tree-based data structures in C++:

- **Binary Search Tree (BST):**  
  - Supports insertion, deletion and a visual display (both balanced and level order).
  - Displays the maximum element along with its level.

- **Balanced Binary Tree:**  
  - Uses a balanced insertion method.
  - Allows deletion of the last inserted element.
  - Displays the tree and checks properties such as full, complete and perfect.

- **Heap:**  
  - Implements both MinHeap and MaxHeap functionalities.
  - Visualizes the heap as a tree with `/` and `\` representing parent-child connections.
  - Allows dynamic switching between MinHeap and MaxHeap even after creation.

## Features

- **Insertion & Deletion:** Easily add and remove elements in each data structure.
- **Visual Display:**  
  - Structured top-down visualization for both trees and heap.
  - Level order (BFS) traversal for BST.
- **Heap Type Switching:**  
  - Change between min-heap and max-heap on the fly.
- **Tree Property Analysis:** Check if binary trees are full, complete or perfect.
- **Robust Input Handling:** Ensures only valid integer inputs are accepted.

## Prerequisites

- **For Building from Source:**
  - [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) (2019 or later with C++ development)
  - Alternatively, a C++ compiler such as `g++` (for command-line builds)

- **For Running Pre-Built Releases:**
  - No development tools required, just the executable for windows operating system
