# Binary Search Tree and Balanced Binary Tree Implementations in C++

This project is a Visual Studio solution demonstrating two tree data structures in C++: a Binary Search Tree (BST) and a Balanced Binary Tree. It features:

- **Insertion & Deletion:** Add and remove elements from both trees.
- **Visual Display:** Show trees in a structured, top-down format.
- **Traversal & Analysis:** Perform level order traversal (BFS) and check tree properties (full, complete, perfect).
- **Maximum Element (BST):** Display the maximum element along with its level.
- **Robust Input Handling:** Validate user input to ensure a smooth experience.



### Prerequisites
