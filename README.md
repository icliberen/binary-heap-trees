# Binary Search Tree and Balanced Binary Tree Implementations in C++

This project demonstrates two different tree data structures in C++: a Binary Search Tree (BST) and a Balanced Binary Tree.

## Functions

- **Insertion & Deletion:** Add and remove elements from the trees.
- **Display:** Visualize the trees in a top-down representation.
- **Level Order Traversal:** Traverse the Binary Search Tree using Breadth-First Search (BFS).
- **Tree Properties:** Check if the Balanced Binary Tree is full, complete, or perfect.
- **Max Element Display (Binary Search Tree):** Show both the maximum element and its level in the Binary Search Tree.
- **Error Handling:** User input is validated to ensure a robust experience.

## Features

- **Persistent State:** The trees are created only once and persist across menu operations.
- **Menus:** Interactive console menus that allow you to switch between the Binary Search Tree and Binary Tree functionalities.
- **Input Validation:** Ensures that only valid integer inputs are accepted.
- **Visual Tree Representation:** Both trees are displayed in a structured, visual format.
