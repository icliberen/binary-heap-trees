# Binary Search Tree and Balanced Binary Tree Implementations in C++

This project is a Visual Studio solution demonstrating two tree data structures in C++: a Binary Search Tree (BST) and a Balanced Binary Tree. It features:

- **Insertion & Deletion:** Add and remove elements from both trees.
- **Visual Display:** Show trees in a structured, top-down format.
- **Traversal & Analysis:** Perform level order traversal (BFS) and check tree properties (full, complete, perfect).
- **Maximum Element (BST):** Display the maximum element along with its level.
- **Robust Input Handling:** Validate user input to ensure a smooth experience.

## Prerequisites

- **For Building from Source:**
  - [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) (2019 or later with C++ development)
  - Alternatively, a C++ compiler such as `g++` (for command-line builds)

- **For Running Pre-Built Releases:**
  - No development tools requiredâ€”just the executable for windows operating system
